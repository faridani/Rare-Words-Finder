Rare Words Finder
================

Takes a txt file and counts the number of occurances for each word

Why I wrote this code
---------------------
I wanted to have a list of words that apprear in Isacson's biography of Steve Jobs
The sample output file for Job's bio is included in the "Sample Output" folder.

More purposes for the code
--------------------------
It is a useful piece of code. Especially if you do NLP work it might be useful for you.
